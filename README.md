# esp.serialplatter
serial platter with timer interrupt with micro esp32

In this repository, Part of the project is to build an ecg device using an esp32 micro and through the desired pin (here pin 35), display the signal with an interval so that the micro works with a frequency of 1 kHz.

Also, this code has a memory and according to the ecg device, it stores and displays the signal from the beginning to the stop of the program.
